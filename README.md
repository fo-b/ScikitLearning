## Data gathering and capture
Raw data was captured during a live stream of a well-known German streamer using the stream platform's own API. For more information, read [here](https://dev.twitch.tv): 

See [here]() how **I** did it very simply with just a few lines of code.

## Output

You can see here the report that was created from the data input and my assignments for the cluster keywords:

|Weighted Avg|   0.92   |   0.92   |   0.90   |  11782  |

## Conclusion

I will gather some more data from the platform and its chat to achieve higher scores with the model. After reaching a specific point, the model should be able to make more specific predictions than it does today.
